This program is a maze solver. 
When running the program using the command line, write the path of the file as the first argument. Then, you can run the program straight away without a second argument. This prints out the maze. Otherwise, you can write "--solution" for the second argument to see the solution for the maze.
In this program, the maze solver uses the Stack ADT as opposed to the Queue ADT, as Stack ADTs only allow the top element to be accessed / removed / added (LIFO operation). This simulates the "back-tracking" behavior of the program as the latest step is retaken to find a different route. This is impossible with Queue ADTs, since FIFO operation only allows adding at the bottom, and the final element to be removed or looked at. This does not simulate the "back-tracking" behavior of the program, since the latest step taken is the last element that can be accessed.

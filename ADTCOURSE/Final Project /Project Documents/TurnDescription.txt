TURN OVER!

When a turn starts, the player will have a choice to control a subordinate. 
    This can be any subordinate in an organization, given that it is not a leaf node (personnel).
    An exception is made for societies, where any member can be moved.
When decided on a subordinate, the player will be given 
    the amount of action points (the number of children) + 1 (to recruit a personnel next to the subordinate at any coordinate.)
When all action point is used up, turn starts for the AI. Turn ends for the player.
When the player navigates through the organization, they can navigate anywhere, but not to the boss or leaf nodes.
If the player runs a society, then action points be dependent on the number of members in the society - 1.
